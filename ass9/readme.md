# E-commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website built with **TypeScript**, **Bootstrap**, and **FakeStoreAPI**. It features authentication, product filtering, cart management, and a checkout process, providing users with an interactive shopping experience.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can log in with a username and password (mocked via FakeStoreAPI).
- **Product Filters**: Filter products by price, category, and search query.
- **Product Sorting**: Sort products by price (low to high or high to low).
- **Product Display**: Display products with images, titles, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the shopping cart and view the total price.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive, clean, and modern UI components.
- **FakeStoreAPI**: For fetching mock product data and handling authentication.
